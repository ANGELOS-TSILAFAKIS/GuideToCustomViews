# GuideToCustomViews
The ultimate guide to Android custom views

I've been designing, writing and publishing Android custom views for the past 5 years now. I guess it's about time to sum it up and share the results. Here you will find the topics related to custom views and a couple of case studies. Code samples will be in Java and Kotlin randomly and the code will be as simple as possible to demonstrate ideas and techniques better.

### Topics

1. [Basics](https://github.com/ZieIony/GuideToCustomViews/wiki/Basics)
1. [What to extend](https://github.com/ZieIony/GuideToCustomViews/wiki/What-to-extend)
1. [Prefix everything](https://github.com/ZieIony/GuideToCustomViews/wiki/Prefix-everything)
1. [Constructors](https://github.com/ZieIony/GuideToCustomViews/wiki/Constructors)
1. [Measuring](https://github.com/ZieIony/GuideToCustomViews/wiki/Measuring)

### Case studies

1. [ProgressTextView](https://github.com/ZieIony/GuideToCustomViews/wiki/ProgressTextView). A progress bar that also has a text. The text should be drawn in one color on the 'done' part of the progress and in another color on the 'remaining' part. [Code](https://github.com/ZieIony/GuideToCustomViews/tree/master/progresstextview).
1. GraphView. A simple bar graph with color state lists and bar selecting with clicks. Topics covered: drawing on canvas, state lists, touch events. [Code](https://github.com/ZieIony/GuideToCustomViews/tree/master/graphview).
1. FlowLayout. A layout that displays its children in rows, side to side and then in another line. Topics covered: measuring, laying out. [Code](https://github.com/ZieIony/GuideToCustomViews/tree/master/flowlayout).
